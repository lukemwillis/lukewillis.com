# Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Luke Willis.

## I'm the dApp UX guy. I build dApps that are easy and free to use.

Blockchain technology gets a bad rap. Scams and misunderstandings abound. Ultimately, blockchain is just **infrastructure that belongs to everyone**. You don't have to be technical or rich to benefit from it. Blockchain isn't just a money grab. It's about giving **power to the people**.

### New here? 

The easiest way to follow my work is to subscribe to my newsletter. I publish (almost) daily, keeping it short. Most days, you can level up your blockchain understanding in **less than a minute**.

### About Luke

I've been writing and podcasting about blockchain technology since 2021 because it helps me think deeply and learn faster. I build dApps on [the Koinos blockchain](//koinos.io) because of the incredibly supportive community and accessibility to outsiders. 

My background is as a traditional full stack web developer -- working with various languages, frameworks, and platforms. I've consulted for companies large and small in a variety of industries, led and coached teams of developers, and built some pretty interesting software along the way.
