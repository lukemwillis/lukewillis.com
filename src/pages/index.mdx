### About Luke

I've been a traditional full stack web dev for close to 10 years -- working in various languages, frameworks, and platforms. I consulted for companies large and small across many industries, lead and coached teams of developers, and built some pretty interesting software along the way.

In the last year, I started learning, writing, and podcasting about blockchain at <a href="//thekoinpress.com">TheKoinPress.com</a>. I'm building dApps of my own, sharing my experience, and will soon offer coaching services and products to help you move faster with web3. If you want to build decentralized applications that are capable of mass adoption and run a profitable business doing so, you've come to the right place.
