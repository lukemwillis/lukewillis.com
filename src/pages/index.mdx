# Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Luke Willis.

## I'm a web3 consultant who helps indie game studios add NFTs to their games without alienating their players.

Gamers have a lot to gain by embracing blockchain, but any attempt by studios to add NFTs to their games is met with player outrage. I'm on a mission to bring web3 to gamers in the most accessible way possible. This isn't just a money grab. It's about giving power to the players.

### About Luke

I've been sharing my perspective on blockchain through writing and podcasting at <a href="//thekoinpress.com">TheKoinPress.com</a> since 2021. I'm building dApps of my own and helping indie game studios add blockchain-powered experiences to their games without alienating their players. If you want to build dApps that your existing non-blockchain customers can use and appreciate, you've come to the right place.

My background is as a traditional full stack web dev -- working in various languages, frameworks, and platforms. I've consulted for companies large and small in a variety of industries, lead and coached teams of developers, and built some pretty interesting software along the way. I typically work with the CEO and CTO to help set your web3 strategy, but I also speak developer and can help teach your teams blockchain fundamentals.
