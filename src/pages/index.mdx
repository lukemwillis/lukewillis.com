### About Luke

I've been a traditional full stack web dev for 10 years -- working in various languages, frameworks, and platforms. I've consulted for companies large and small in a variety of industries, lead and coached teams of developers, and built some pretty interesting software along the way.

In 2021, I started sharing my learnings on blockchain through writing and podcasting at <a href="//thekoinpress.com">TheKoinPress.com</a>. I'm building dApps of my own and helping traditional centralized companies add blockchain-powered experiences to their apps without alienating their users. If you want to build decentralized applications that your existing non-blockchain customers can use and appreciate, you've come to the right place.
