# web3 strategy call

## Clear, actionable advice, guaranteed.

If you like the idea of blockchain, but aren't sure how it can work for your game studio, I will answer your questions and provide clarity on where to start.

### How does this work?

We'll schedule 60 minutes, but you may choose to block some additional time in case we go over a bit. The call will be over Google Meet. You tell me about your business and why you're interested in adding blockchain to your games. I will give you specific advice on what to do next.

This discussion is entirely based on your interests, questions, and concerns, but it's typical to talk about:

 - How to monetize a game with blockchain
 - How to build on blockchain so your existing players can keep playing
 - How to talk about blockchain without a PR disaster
 - How to get the most out of your blockchain integration

After the call, I will share the recording with you and be available over email for follow up questions for one week.

### 100% money back guarantee

I'm confident you'll walk away from this call with a clear understanding of how to use blockchain in your games. Once we're done, if you feel like it wasn't worth the money, let me know and I will refund your payment in full.
